# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Install BMAD Skills

**Transform your Claude Code experience with a complete product development workflow.**

## Installation (Choose One)

### Option 1: NPX (Recommended - Fastest)

```bash
# Install globally (works in all projects)
npx bmad-skills --global

# Or install to current project only
npx bmad-skills
```

### Option 2: Direct Script

```bash
# Install globally
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacoco/bmad-skills/main/scripts/install-to-home.sh | bash

## What You Get

After installation, 12 specialized skills will automatically activate in your Claude Code conversations:

**ðŸ’¡ Just talk naturally:**
- "I have an idea..." â†’ Analyst activates
- "Create a PRD" â†’ PM activates
- "How should we build this?" â†’ Architecture activates
- "Break this into stories" â†’ Stories activates
- "Implement story 1" â†’ Dev activates

**No commands. No configuration. Just conversation.**
