# Performance Optimization Checklist

Use this to confirm readiness and coverage before closing the engagement.

## Entry Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets (SLAs/SLOs, budgets) are documented.
- [ ] Observability data collected (metrics, traces, logs, profiles).
- [ ] Workload assumptions clarified (traffic mix, concurrency, geographical distribution).
- [ ] Architecture and deployment topology validated for currency.

## Analysis Coverage
- [ ] Baseline metrics established for response time, throughput, and resource usage.
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified across application, database, network, and client tiers.
- [ ] Capacity constraints (CPU, memory, storage, connections) recorded.
- [ ] Regressions or anomalies correlated to releases or infrastructure events.

## Plan & Recommendations
- [ ] Load/benchmark test plan defined with tooling, scenarios, and success criteria.
- [ ] Optimization backlog prioritized by impact vs. effort.
- [ ] Each backlog item includes owner, acceptance criteria, and measurement plan.
- [ ] Cost/performance trade-offs documented (e.g., scaling vs. optimization).

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Performance brief, benchmark plan, and backlog stored in workspace.
- [ ] Risks and dependencies communicated to orchestrator and relevant skills.
- [ ] Follow-up validation (post-optimization testing) scheduled or delegated.
