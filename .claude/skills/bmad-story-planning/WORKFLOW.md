# Workflow â€” Epic to Story Breakdown

1. **Intake & Readiness**
   - Confirm orchestrator sign-off to enter delivery planning.
   - Gather PRD, epics, architecture decisions, and UX assets.

2. **Backlog Shaping**
   - Sequence epics and identify the highest-value vertical slice to tackle.
   - Note cross-epic dependencies or enabling work.

3. **Story Authoring**
   - For each story: capture summary, acceptance criteria, non-functional needs, dependencies, and Dev Agent Record shell.
   - Reference architecture components and UX touchpoints explicitly.

4. **Validation & Tooling**
   - Execute `scripts/create_story.py` when structured data is available.
   - Update sprint tracker or backlog summary with statuses and owners.

5. **Handoff**
   - Provide development-execution and quality-assurance skills with prioritized story list.
   - Log blockers, assumptions, and next review checkpoints.
