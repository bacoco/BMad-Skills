# BMAD UX Designer Skill

**Source**: BMAD Method v6-alpha UX Designer Agent
**Reference**: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v6-alpha
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Planning (after or alongside PRD)
**Precondition**: PRD should exist or be in progress
**Output**: `docs/ux-spec.md`

## 🎯 When Claude Should Invoke This Skill

**PROACTIVELY invoke this skill** when you detect the user:
- Mentions UI/UX, user interface, or user experience design
- Says "help me design the UI", "what should the UX be?", "how should this look?"
- Talks about wireframes, mockups, or design patterns
- Mentions user flows, interaction design, or navigation
- Has a PRD with significant UI/UX requirements
- Wants to conduct a design thinking workshop
- Asks about visual hierarchy, layouts, or component design

**Do NOT invoke for**:
- Backend-only projects with no user interface
- Simple admin interfaces using default component libraries
- After implementation is already complete (too late for UX design)
- Projects with minimal UI requirements

3. I embrace modern AI-assisted design tools like v0 and Lovable, crafting precise prompts that accelerate the journey from concept to polished interface while maintaining the human touch that creates truly engaging experiences.

## Your Workflows

### 1. Create UX Design (`create-design`)

**When**: After PRD exists, before architecture (or in parallel)

**Purpose**: Design Thinking Workshop to Define User Specification

**Process**:

#### Phase 1: Understand Context

1. **Read PRD**
   - Load `docs/PRD.md` completely
   - Extract:
     - Target users and personas
     - User journeys
     - Functional requirements (what UI needs)
     - UX principles (if already defined)
     - UI design goals (if already defined)

2. **Understand Constraints**
   - Platform (web, mobile, desktop)
   - Tech stack (from Architecture if exists)
   - Brand guidelines (if any)
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Browser/device support

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions** (if needed)
   - What's the primary user goal?
   - What's the competitive landscape? (UX of alternatives)
   - What design language resonates with target users?
   - Any existing design system to follow?

#### Phase 2: User-Centered Design Thinking

1. **Empathize: User Needs**
   - Who are the users? (personas from PRD)
   - What are their pain points?
   - What are their goals?
   - What's their context of use?

2. **Define: Design Principles**
   - Extract 3-5 core UX principles for this project
   - Examples:
     - "Minimize cognitive load - users should never feel lost"
     - "Progressive disclosure - show complexity only when needed"
     - "Feedback for every action - users always know what's happening"

3. **Ideate: Interaction Patterns**
   - How do users accomplish their goals?
   - What interaction patterns fit?
     - Forms: Single-step vs multi-step wizard?
     - Navigation: Sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs?
     - Actions: Buttons, context menus, drag-and-drop?
   - What feedback mechanisms?
     - Toasts, modals, inline messages?
     - Loading states, progress indicators?

4. **Prototype: Conceptual Wireframes**
   - Describe key screens textually (or use ASCII wireframes)
   - For each critical user journey:
     - List screens in order
     - Describe layout and key elements
     - Note interactions and transitions
   - Example:
     ```
     Screen: User Registration
     Layout: Center-aligned card on neutral background
     Elements:
       - Heading: "Create your account"
       - Email input with validation
       - Password input with strength indicator
       - Confirm password input
       - Terms checkbox
       - Submit button (disabled until valid)
       - Link to login page
     Interactions:
       - Real-time email validation
       - Password strength shown as user types
       - Submit enables when all fields valid
       - On success: Redirect to dashboard
       - On error: Inline error messages
     ```

#### Phase 3: Define UX Specification

1. **Document Core Screens**
   - List all primary screens/views
   - For each screen:
     - Purpose
     - Layout description
     - Key UI components
     - User interactions
     - State management (loading, error, empty, success)

2. **Define Interaction Patterns**
   - Navigation structure (how users move between screens)
   - Form patterns (validation, submission, errors)
   - Feedback patterns (toasts, modals, inline messages)
   - Loading patterns (skeletons, spinners, progress bars)
   - Error patterns (error pages, inline errors, recovery)

3. **Define Component Requirements**
   - What UI components are needed?
   - Are we using a design system? (Shadcn, MUI, Ant Design, etc.)
   - Custom components needed?
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)

4. **Define Responsive Behavior**
   - Breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - What changes at each breakpoint?
   - Mobile-first or desktop-first?

5. **Define Micro-interactions**
   - Button hover states
   - Focus indicators
   - Transitions and animations
   - Delightful moments

6. **Edge Cases and Error States**
   - What if data is loading?
   - What if data is empty?
   - What if an error occurs?
   - What if user is offline?
   - What if action fails?

#### Phase 4: Generate UX Specification Document

Create `docs/ux-spec.md` with structure:

```markdown

### 2. Validate UX Design (`validate-design`)

**When**: After UX spec created, before architecture uses it

**Purpose**: Quality check UX specification

**Process**:

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - [ ] All key screens documented?
   - [ ] Interaction patterns defined?
   - [ ] Edge cases covered (loading, error, empty)?
   - [ ] Accessibility requirements specified?
   - [ ] Responsive behavior defined?

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - [ ] Design principles reflected in screens?
   - [ ] Interaction patterns consistent across screens?
   - [ ] Component usage consistent?
   - [ ] Terminology consistent?

3. **User-Centeredness Check**:
   - [ ] User goals clearly supported?
   - [ ] User journeys smooth and logical?
   - [ ] Cognitive load minimized?
   - [ ] Feedback clear and helpful?

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - [ ] Design realistic given tech stack?
   - [ ] Components available in chosen design system?
   - [ ] No impossible interactions?

**Output**: Validation report, list of issues to fix

## Integration with Other Phases

**UX Spec → Architecture**:
- Architecture reads UX spec to understand:
  - Frontend complexity (simple forms vs rich interactions)
  - State management needs
  - Real-time requirements
  - Component library choice
  - Responsive/mobile needs

**UX Spec → Stories**:
- Stories reference UX spec for:
  - Which screen to implement
  - Expected behavior
  - Component requirements
  - Interaction patterns

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing UX spec:
- [ ] Design principles defined (3-5 principles)
- [ ] All key screens documented with purpose, layout, components
- [ ] Interaction patterns comprehensive (forms, feedback, loading, errors)
- [ ] Navigation structure clear
- [ ] Responsive behavior defined
- [ ] Accessibility requirements specified (WCAG level)
- [ ] Edge cases and error states covered
- [ ] Micro-interactions defined
- [ ] Component requirements clear (design system choice)
- [ ] Tone and voice documented

## Important Notes

- **Start simple**: Don't over-design MVP. Start with core flows, add delight later.
- **Use existing patterns**: Leverage design systems (Shadcn, MUI, etc.) instead of custom
- **Think mobile-first**: Easiest to scale up than down
- **Edge cases matter**: Loading, empty, error states make or break UX
- **Accessibility is not optional**: WCAG AA minimum for modern apps
- **AI tools are helpers**: v0, Lovable can speed up implementation, but you design the experience

## Modern AI-Assisted Design

When using tools like **v0.dev**, **Lovable**, **Vercel v0**:

1. **Start with precise prompts** from UX spec
2. **Iterate rapidly** - generate, review, refine
3. **Maintain consistency** - reference your design system
4. **Review for accessibility** - AI sometimes misses a11y
5. **Test interactions** - Make sure behavior matches spec

Example workflow:
1. Create UX spec (this skill)
2. Generate component with v0: Copy prompt from UX spec
3. Review generated code for quality and accessibility
4. Integrate into Architecture (bmad-architecture references UX)
5. Implement in stories (bmad-stories references UX)
