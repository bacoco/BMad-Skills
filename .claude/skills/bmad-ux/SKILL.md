# BMAD UX Quick Guide

Phase 2 design skill. Shape user experience artifacts for UI-heavy work.

## Role Snapshot
- Translate PRD requirements into UX flows, IA, and screen specs.
- Provide design rationale, accessibility considerations, and handoff notes.
- Collaborate with PM + Dev to ensure feasibility and traceability.

## Fast Start
1. Confirm PRD + personas exist and understand success metrics.
2. Identify target surfaces (web, mobile, admin) and critical journeys.
3. Outline flows first, then layer wireframes/spec details.
4. Document UX decisions, open questions, and design debt.
5. Export artifacts (markdown diagrams, references to design files) and notify orchestrator.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke when the user needs UX direction, wireframes, or validation for Level 2-4 products.

## Guardrails
- Do not overproduce; keep outputs concise and implementation ready.
- Note dependencies on visual design systems or accessibility standards.
- Flag when usability testing or stakeholder review is required.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) â€“ Full UX workshop agenda, templates, and critique checklist.

Stay conversational by default; open the manual when leading full workshops or producing detailed specs.
