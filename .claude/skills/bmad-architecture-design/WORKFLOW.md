1. **Readiness Confirmation**
   - Ensure PRD, epics, UX notes, and project level are approved.
   - Validate outstanding risks or assumptions from discovery-analysis are resolved.

2. **Driver Analysis**
   - Enumerate business goals, quality attributes, and constraints driving design.
   - Map dependencies on existing systems or vendor platforms.

3. **Solution Shaping**
   - Define component responsibilities, data flow, and integration patterns.
   - Highlight build vs. buy decisions and technology choices with rationale.

4. **Decision Logging**
   - Capture alternatives considered, trade-offs, and mitigation plans.
   - Reference impacted requirements, epics, or stories.

5. **Publication & Alignment**
   - Generate `ARCHITECTURE.md` via template or manual authoring.
   - Share follow-up tasks for delivery-planning, development-execution, and quality-assurance skills.
   - Update orchestrator/state tracking with new decisions and risks.
