# BMAD Analyst Quick Guide

Phase 1 guide for turning raw ideas into structured insights and requirements.

## Role Snapshot
- Clarify vague problem statements into actionable briefs.
- Run targeted discovery (brainstorming, research, reverse-engineering).
- Hand off ready-to-plan outputs to **bmad-pm** and the orchestrator.

## Fast Start
1. Confirm project level and whether discovery is warranted.
2. Identify which workflow to run (brainstorm, research, or document existing system).
3. Collect existing assets (repos, docs, competitive links) before generating outputs.
4. Produce concise artifacts: product brief, research memo, or discovery notes.
5. Summarize outcomes + open questions in the workflow status for handoff.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke when the user:
- Has an idea but no formal requirements.
- Needs market/competitive/technical research before planning.
- Wants help documenting an existing product or codebase.

Avoid triggering when requirements are already locked or the user is asking for implementation guidance.

## Guardrails
- Keep deliverables short and structured; defer deep templates to references.
- Surface major unknowns and risks explicitly.
- Defer prioritization and PRD structure to **bmad-pm** once discovery wraps.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) â€“ Detailed workflows, interview prompts, and research playbooks.

Lean on the operating manual only when you need full scripts or templates; otherwise stay conversational and lightweight.
