# OpenSpec Propose Quick Guide

Stage 1 skill for framing lightweight change proposals.

## Role Snapshot
- Capture the problem, target behavior, and constraints quickly.
- Produce proposal + task skeletons sized for Level 0-1 changes.
- Align stakeholders before implementation begins.

## Fast Start
1. Clarify the change: scope, current behavior, desired outcome.
2. Identify affected files/systems and quick feasibility checks.
3. Draft `proposal.md` with summary, acceptance, and risk notes.
4. Outline tasks in `tasks.md` (small, testable steps).
5. Highlight approvals needed and hand off to orchestrator for review.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke for bug fixes or small enhancements to existing systems.

## Guardrails
- Keep scope narrow; if requirements balloon, escalate to BMAD workflow.
- Avoid solutioning deeply—capture intent and leave details for implementation.
- Note unknowns and dependencies so reviewers can resolve before coding.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) – Proposal template, scoping heuristics, and approval checklist.

Default to concise proposals; open the manual when you need structured templates or examples.
