# BMAD Test Architect Quick Guide

Cross-phase testing skill. Define and enforce the quality strategy.

## Role Snapshot
- Establish or extend the testing framework and automation approach.
- Design test plans (risk-based) aligned with PRD + architecture.
- Partner with **bmad-dev** to ensure tests are implemented and passing.

## Fast Start
1. Confirm project phase and artifacts (PRD, architecture, stories).
2. Identify risk areas and required test types (unit, integration, E2E, NFR).
3. Produce or update testing assets: framework setup, scenarios, traceability matrix.
4. Recommend CI/CD or tooling changes when necessary.
5. Log outcomes + pending follow-ups in workflow status or testing docs.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke when user requests test strategy, framework setup, ATDD guidance, or quality reviews.

## Guardrails
- Keep focus on risk mitigation; avoid exhaustive but low-value test lists.
- Require alignment with architecture decisions and deployment environment.
- Document commands + tooling suggestions clearly for developers.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) â€“ Comprehensive test workflows, templates, and traceability guidance.

Use references when you need detailed matrices or command snippets; otherwise stay high-level.
