# Automation Notes

Security review automation is intentionally lightweight. Future enhancements may include:
- SBOM ingestion and CVE triage helpers.
- Automated STRIDE checklist generation from architecture diagrams.
- Integration hooks for dependency scanners (Snyk, Trivy, osv-scanner).

Current workflow relies on conversational guidance plus the templates in `../assets`.
