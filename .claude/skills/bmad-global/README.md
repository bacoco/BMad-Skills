# BMAD Global - Complete Workflow System

**The entire BMAD ecosystem in a single skill.**

## What is BMAD Global?

BMAD Global is an **intelligent orchestrator** that provides the complete BMAD workflow experience through a single, unified skill. Instead of manually selecting which sub-skill to invoke, simply describe what you want to do - BMAD Global automatically routes your work through the right process.

- ðŸ”„ **Two-track system** - OpenSpec for quick changes, BMAD for complex work
- ðŸ“Š **Progress tracking** - Always know where you are
- ðŸŽ¯ **Phase management** - Automatic prerequisite checking
- ðŸ’¬ **Natural language** - No commands needed
- ðŸ“¦ **Complete workflow** - Discovery â†’ Planning â†’ UX â†’ Architecture â†’ Testing â†’ Stories â†’ Code

### Usage

Just start talking:

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Standalone (This Skill Only)

Best for: Trying out BMAD, lightweight installation

```bash
# Clone or download this directory
cp -r bmad-global ~/.claude/skills/

# BMAD Global will guide you through workflow
# But won't have access to sub-skill automation
```

**Note:** Standalone mode uses conversational routing without specialized sub-skills.

### Option 2: Complete Bundle

Best for: Full features, team usage, production

```bash
# Install complete BMAD Skills bundle
npm install -g bmad-skills

# Or via direct download
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacoco/bmad-skills/main/scripts/install-to-home.sh | bash
```

**Includes:** All 11 sub-skills + bmad-global + automation scripts

### Option 3: Custom Installation

Best for: Specific needs, selective skills

```bash
# Install just the skills you need
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r bmad-global ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r ../main-workflow-router ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r ../bmad-discovery-research ~/.claude/skills/
# ... add others as needed
```

## Configuration

### Workspace Structure

BMAD Global uses:
```
_runtime/workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ artifacts/    # Planning docs, architecture, PRDs
â”œâ”€â”€ stories/      # Developer stories
â”œâ”€â”€ changes/      # OpenSpec change proposals
â””â”€â”€ specs/        # OpenSpec specifications
```

### Customization

Edit `SKILL.md` to customize:
- Trigger patterns
- Routing logic
- Default complexity levels
- Phase order

## Troubleshooting

**"BMAD Global seems stuck"**
- Say: "What's the status?"
- Or: "Show me where we are"

**"Wrong phase selected"**
- Override: "Let's jump to [phase]"
- Or: "Skip [phase]"

**"Too much overhead"**
- Say: "This is a quick fix"
- Or: "Keep it simple"
