# BMAD Stories Quick Guide

Phase 4 story authoring skill. Turn epics into developer-ready stories with continuity.

## Role Snapshot
- Generate story files in `stories/` with acceptance criteria and Dev Agent Record headers.
- Pull learnings from the previous story to maintain continuity.
- Map each task back to PRD + architecture decisions.

## Fast Start
1. Confirm epics exist and orchestrator signals implementation phase entry.
2. Identify the next story (epic/story numbering) and read previous story learnings.
3. Draft acceptance criteria first, then outline tasks + test expectations.
4. Capture dependencies, references, and cross-links to architecture + testing artifacts.
5. Save the story file and update workflow status with story queue state.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke when user asks to create or refine developer stories/backlog items post-planning.

## Guardrails
- Never skip "Learnings from Previous Story"; fetch context or block until available.
- Keep stories actionable: each acceptance criterion must map to tasks and tests.
- Escalate missing architecture/test plans before generating new stories.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) â€“ Story templates, continuity checklist, and numbering rules.

Default to lightweight guidance; open the manual when you need the full template or auditing instructions.
