## Overview

This document provides the complete tactical implementation roadmap for $project_name.
Each epic contains sequenced user stories with acceptance criteria and prerequisites.

**Epic Sequencing Rules:**
1. Epic 1 establishes foundation (infrastructure, CI/CD, core setup)
2. Subsequent epics build upon previous work
3. No forward dependencies across epics

**Story Requirements:**
- **Vertical slices**: Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
- **Sequential**: Stories are logically ordered within each epic
- **AI-agent sized**: Completable in single focused session (2-4 hours)
- **No forward dependencies**: No story depends on work from later stories
