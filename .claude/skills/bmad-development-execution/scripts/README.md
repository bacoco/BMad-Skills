# Scripts Directory - bmad-development-execution

## Purpose

This directory is reserved for future automation scripts that may assist with development tasks.

## Current Status

The bmad-development-execution skill currently operates entirely through conversation-driven implementation. No automation scripts are required at this time because:

1. **Code generation** is handled directly by the skill through the Write and Edit tools
2. **Test execution** is performed via Bash tool integration with project-specific test commands
3. **Implementation notes** are created manually by the developer during the coding process

## Future Enhancements

Potential scripts that may be added in future versions:

- **generate_implementation_notes.py** - Auto-generate implementation notes from git diff and commit messages
- **run_test_suite.py** - Standardized test runner with coverage reporting
- **code_quality_check.py** - Pre-commit quality gates and linting automation

## Contributing

If you identify repetitive manual tasks in the development workflow that could benefit from automation, consider adding a script here following the BMAD path resolution standards:

```python
from pathlib import Path

SKILLS_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]  # .claude/skills/
RUNTIME_ROOT = SKILLS_ROOT / "_runtime"
```
