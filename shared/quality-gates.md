# Shared Quality Gates

1. **Completeness** — Required inputs validated, outputs produced using canonical templates, and checklists satisfied.
2. **Traceability** — Each decision and deliverable references upstream artifacts or sources.
3. **Test Evidence** — Implementation and quality skills must supply explicit commands and results.
4. **Risk Visibility** — Blockers, assumptions, and follow-ups are documented with owners and due dates.
5. **Version Control** — Skills update `version` metadata and MANIFEST entries when behavior changes materially.
