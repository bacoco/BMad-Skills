# BMAD Skills Audit â€” 2024-02-24

## Summary
All outstanding audit actions from 2024-02-22 are now complete. The bundle is dependency-free outside of `.claude/skills/`, runtime guidance is unified on `_runtime/workspace/`, and documentation matches the enforced governance requirements.

## Findings
1. **External dependencies eliminated.** The validator no longer imports PyYAML and relies on a bundled standard-library parser. Top-level `requirements.txt` retains only the dev-time `pytest` dependency, keeping the published bundle self-contained.
2. **Runtime workspace guidance aligned.** Contributor READMEs, installation scripts, and CLAUDE.md now reference the `_runtime/workspace/` layout, and the workspace includes `artifacts/` and `stories/` subdirectories alongside the OpenSpec `changes/` and `specs/` folders.
3. **Validator behavior documented.** The changelog has been updated to note the switch to the internal parser, preserving historical context for auditors.
