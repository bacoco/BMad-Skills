# BMAD-Style Workflow Skills for Claude

**Version**: 2.1.0 - Proactive Skills
**Source**: BMAD Method v6-alpha
**Reference**: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v6-alpha

---

## üéâ Complete BMAD Implementation with Proactive Invocation

This repository is a **complete, faithful implementation** of BMAD Method v6-alpha as Claude Code Skills. All 7 agents, all workflows, full state management - **with automatic, proactive skill invocation**.

**What's Included:**
- ‚úÖ **All 7 BMAD Agents** as Skills
- ‚úÖ **Proactive Auto-Invocation** - Claude detects context and invokes skills automatically
- ‚úÖ **Complete Workflow Orchestration** with state management
- ‚úÖ **Python Helpers** for workflow-status and sprint-status
- ‚úÖ **All 4 Phases** (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation)
- ‚úÖ **Story Lifecycle Management**
- ‚úÖ **BMAD Agent Personas** preserved exactly from v6-alpha

## üöÄ How It Works

**You don't need to manually invoke skills!** Claude automatically detects what you need based on your conversation and proactively invokes the right skill.

### Example Conversations

```
User: "I have an idea for a collaborative todo app"

Claude: I detect you're starting a new project with a vague idea.
Let me invoke bmad-analyst to help you explore this...

[Analyst skill activates - helps brainstorm and create product brief]
```

```
User: "I want to build a REST API for user authentication"

Claude: You're describing a Level 2-3 project. Let me invoke
bmad-pm to help create a Product Requirements Document...

[PM skill activates - creates PRD and epics]
```

```
User: "How should we architect this microservices system?"

Claude: I detect you need architectural planning. Let me invoke
bmad-architecture to define your technical solution...

[Architecture skill activates - creates ARCHITECTURE.md]
```

**No slash commands needed.** Just talk naturally about what you want to build, and Claude will guide you through the right BMAD workflow.

### üéØ Conversational Triggers

Each skill has natural language triggers that Claude detects automatically:

| What You Say | Skill Invoked | What Happens |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| "I have an idea...", "What if we...", "Help me think through..." | `bmad-analyst` | Brainstorming and product brief creation |
| "I want to build...", "Create a PRD", "Plan this feature" | `bmad-pm` | PRD and epics generation |
| "What should the UI look like?", "Design the UX" | `bmad-ux` | UX specification and design thinking |
| "How should we build this?", "What's the architecture?" | `bmad-architecture` | Technical architecture and stack decisions |
| "How should we test?", "Create test strategy" | `bmad-tea` | Test framework and ATDD implementation |
| "Break into stories", "Create user stories" | `bmad-stories` | Developer-ready story file creation |
| "Implement story X", "Develop this feature", "Let's code" | `bmad-dev` | Code implementation with tests |
| "What's next?", "Where am I?", "Start new project" | `bmad-orchestrator` | Workflow status and guidance |

**Claude analyzes your message intent and context**, then invokes the appropriate skill automatically. You just have natural conversations.

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Orchestrator

```
User: "Initialize BMAD workflow"
```

Don't skip initialization - it sets up state management.

### 2. Check Status Frequently

```
User: "What's my BMAD status?"
```

Orchestrator reads state files and recommends next action.

### 3. Complete Phases in Order

- Phase 1: Analysis (optional)
- Phase 2: Planning (required L2-4)
- Phase 3: Solutioning (required L2-4)
- Phase 4: Implementation (iterative)

### 4. Let Orchestrator Manage State

Don't manually edit workflow-status.md or sprint-status.yaml. Let orchestrator and skills update them.

### 5. Story Learnings are Critical

bmad-stories ALWAYS checks previous story. This prevents:
- Recreating existing code
- Ignoring technical debt
- Missing architectural decisions

### 6. Dev Agent Record is Mandatory

bmad-dev MUST update Dev Agent Record as implementation progresses. Next story depends on it.

### 7. Tests are Not Optional

bmad-dev will NOT mark story complete unless:
- All tests written
- All tests passing 100%
- No cheating

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Workflow status file not found"

**Problem**: No workflow-status.md exists

**Solution**: Run workflow initialization:
```
Initialize BMAD workflow
```

### "Sprint status file not found"

**Problem**: No sprint-status.yaml exists

**Solution**: Orchestrator should initialize after epics created. Or manually:
```
Initialize sprint status
```

### "Story has no previous learnings"

**Problem**: Story doesn't reference previous story

**Solution**: bmad-stories should automatically check. If missing, manually read previous story and include learnings.

### "Tests not running"

**Problem**: bmad-dev not executing tests

**Solution**: Ensure test framework initialized (bmad-tea). Verify tests exist. Dev agent MUST run tests, no exceptions.

This implementation preserves BMAD v6-alpha agent personas, workflows, and output formats. It is a faithful vendoring of BMAD logic into Claude Code Skills, not a loose recreation.

**Agent Personas** (preserved from BMAD v6-alpha):
- Mary (Analyst) - Strategic Business Analyst
- John (PM) - Investigative Product Strategist
- Sally (UX Designer) - User Experience Designer
- Winston (Architect) - System Architect
- Murat (TEA) - Master Test Architect
- Bob (Scrum Master) - Technical Scrum Master
- Amelia (DEV) - Senior Implementation Engineer
