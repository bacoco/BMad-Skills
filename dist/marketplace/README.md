# Marketplace Bundles

This directory stores `.skill` packages generated by the packager script.

These archives are not checked into version control. Run:

```bash
python .claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py <skill_path> dist/marketplace
```

to build a bundle before uploading to the Claude marketplace.
