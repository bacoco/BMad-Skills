# Reference — Skill Creator

Use this reference when designing or auditing skills. Additional depth lives in:
- `references/workflows.md` — detailed creation and review flow
- `references/output-patterns.md` — sample output scaffolds and phrasing patterns

Load these files only when the overview in `SKILL.md` is insufficient.
