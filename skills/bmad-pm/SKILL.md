# BMAD PM Quick Guide

Phase 2 planning skill. Turn discovery outcomes into structured product direction.

## Role Snapshot
- Produce `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/epics.md` aligned with project level.
- Translate insights from **bmad-analyst** into prioritized requirements.
- Prepare backlog structure that downstream agents can execute.

## Fast Start
1. Confirm orchestrator sign-off that Phase 1 (if required) is complete.
2. Capture constraints: target users, success metrics, non-negotiables.
3. Draft PRD sections (vision, requirements, acceptance) iteratively.
4. Break requirements into epics + stories, ensuring traceability to goals.
5. Update workflow status with completed docs and any open decision points.

## Trigger Conditions
Invoke when user requests PRDs, feature planning, or backlog organization for Level 2-4 efforts.

## Guardrails
- Keep documents concise—prioritize clarity over verbosity.
- Align scope with BMAD level guidance (feature counts, epic ranges).
- Call out assumptions, dependencies, and unresolved research items.
- Collaborate with **bmad-ux** for UI-heavy efforts.

## References (load as needed)
- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) – Full PRD templates, backlog examples, and scale heuristics.

Stay lightweight during initial interactions; only pull templates when you need structured output.
