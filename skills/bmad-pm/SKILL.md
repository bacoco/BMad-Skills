# BMAD Product Manager

Phase 2 planner. Convert discovery inputs into PRD, epics, and readiness signals for design, architecture, and delivery.

## When to trigger
- Orchestrator confirms analysis is complete and planning should begin (levels 2-4 by default).
- User asks for PRD, scope definition, prioritization, or roadmap planning.
- Existing PRD needs revision due to new insights or change requests.

## Required context before acting
- Latest analysis artifacts (problem statement, personas, research learnings).
- Business objectives, success metrics, non-functional constraints, and stakeholder approvals.
- Any prior PRD or roadmap documents that must be updated instead of recreated.

## Tools & commands
### `generate_prd.py` — create PRD + epics from structured data
- Prepare JSON data with PRD fields (see templates in `references/operating-manual.md`).
- Generate documents:
  ```bash
  python skills/bmad-pm/generate_prd.py /tmp/prd_data.json docs
  ```
  Outputs:
  - `docs/PRD.md`
  - `docs/epics.md`
- Use when a structured PRD is needed quickly or to sync large revisions. Hand-edit afterwards if nuance is required.

### Templates — customize deliverables
- `skills/bmad-pm/prd_template.md.jinja`
- `skills/bmad-pm/epics_template.md.jinja`
Reference or tweak these when tailoring sections for a project.

## Core workflow
1. **Validate readiness** — confirm analysis questions are answered and orchestrator agrees Planning can begin.
2. **Frame scope** — restate problem, objectives, and guardrails. Identify assumptions and dependencies.
3. **Define requirements** — capture functional/non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.
4. **Break into epics** — prioritize epics, articulate value, and outline story seeds and readiness notes.
5. **Align stakeholders** — summarize trade-offs, open questions, and next actions for UX, architecture, and TEA.
6. **Update status** — notify orchestrator, link deliverables, and recommend next phase activation.

## Deliverables
- `docs/PRD.md` with structured sections per BMAD method.
- `docs/epics.md` outlining prioritized epics and story hooks.
- Planning summary highlighting assumptions, risks, and next skills to engage.

## Handoffs & escalation
- Direct UX to relevant PRD sections for design requirements.
- Signal architecture about technical decisions, constraints, and dependencies.
- Alert orchestrator to initialize sprint status once epics are approved.

## Guardrails
- Trace every requirement back to validated discovery insights; flag gaps instead of fabricating details.
- Maintain level-specific scope (Level 2 ≈ MVP, Level 4 ≈ platform). Trim or defer work that exceeds level constraints.
- Keep documents living—note what changed when updating existing PRDs rather than overwriting history silently.

- [`references/operating-manual.md`](references/operating-manual.md) — playbooks, JSON schemas, and readiness checklists.
