# Workflow â€” Story Implementation

1. **Story Intake**
   - Confirm story status is `ready` and prerequisites are satisfied.
   - Review architecture, UX, and quality references.

2. **Plan & Prepare**
   - Outline implementation strategy, affected files, and tests.
   - Set up environment, dependencies, and feature flags if necessary.

3. **Iterative Implementation**
   - Work in small increments, running targeted tests frequently.
   - Capture rationale, assumptions, and unexpected findings.

4. **Verification**
   - Execute agreed test suites (unit, integration, e2e) with recorded output.
   - Compare results against acceptance criteria and non-functional requirements.

5. **Documentation & Handoff**
   - Update story file with status, commands run, and learnings.
   - Summarize code changes for review and notify orchestrator/quality-assurance for follow-up.
