# FULL AUDIT REPORT ‚Äì BMAD Skills Repository
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Auditor:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)  
**Overall Score:** 85/100

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The BMad-Skills repository delivers a sophisticated Claude AI skill architecture for the BMAD methodology. **Technical architecture is excellent (95/100)** while **automatic conversational activation lags behind (45/100)** compared to the Bimath benchmark.

### Verdict

**READY FOR PRODUCTION AFTER CRITICAL ACTIVATION FIXES**

With two to three days of targeted work on automatic activation, the system can reach 95/100 and align with state-of-the-art Claude AI practices.

- `REFERENCE.md` files contain 4,000+ lines of rich knowledge.
- Eleven supporting Python scripts and nine Jinja2 templates.
- Efficient loading: 30‚Äì50 tokens per skill before references are opened.

#### Modularity ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Twelve independent, composable skills.
- Centralized semantic versioning.
- Explicit dependency descriptions.
- Zero duplication between skills.

#### Governance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Style guide (`meta/STYLE-GUIDE.md`).
- Shared glossary (`shared/glossary.md`).
- Automation (`lint_contracts.py`).
- Quality gates enforced per skill.

#### Documentation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## 2. CRITICAL GAPS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üî¥ Gap #1: Weak Automatic Activation
**Compliance:** 45%

**Symptom:** Skills do not auto-activate during natural conversations.

**Root cause:** Descriptions remain technical rather than conversational.

**Current example:**
```yaml
description: "Clarifies ambiguous opportunities through structured research, synthesis, and risk surfacing."
```

**Target example:**
```yaml
description: "Brainstorms ideas and researches projects. Invoke when the user says: 'I have an idea', 'What if we', 'Help me think', 'Explore possibilities'. Keywords: idea, brainstorm, explore, research, new project."
```

**Impact:**
- Users must invoke skills manually.
- Conversation does not follow the Bimath method.
- Claude fails to detect intent reliably.

---

### üî¥ Gap #2: Activation Contracts Hidden in `REFERENCE.md`
**Compliance:** 50%

**Symptom:** The ‚ÄúWhen Claude Should Invoke This Skill‚Äù section appears in `REFERENCE.md` instead of `SKILL.md`.

**Affected files:**
- `.claude/skills/bmad-orchestrator/REFERENCE.md:14-28`
- `.claude/skills/bmad-analyst/REFERENCE.md:14-28`

**Correct interpretation of the best practice:**
- `SKILL.md` = activation contract + primary workflow.
- `REFERENCE.md` = deep domain knowledge.

**Required action:** Move ‚ÄúWhen to Invoke‚Äù into each `SKILL.md` immediately after the front matter.

---

### üî¥ Gap #3: Manual Orchestration Flow
**Compliance:** 40%

**Ideal Bimath experience:**
```
User: "I have an idea for a budgeting app"
Claude: [Auto-detects ‚Üí bmad-analyst ‚Üí brainstorms]
```

**Current experience:**
```
User: "I have an idea for a budgeting app"
Claude: [Waits for "Initialize BMAD workflow"]
```

**Cause:** `bmad-orchestrator` does not auto-activate at the start of new conversations.

## 4. PRIORITY ACTION PLAN

### üî¥ Priority 1: Conversational Descriptions (1 day)

**Action:** Rewrite all twelve descriptions in `meta/MANIFEST.json` using the conversational template.

**Template:**
```yaml
description: "[Plain-language capability]. Invoke when users [say/ask]. Keywords: [list of triggers]."
```

### üî¥ Priority 2: ‚ÄúWhen to Invoke‚Äù Sections (1 day)

**Action:** Copy the activation guidance from `REFERENCE.md` into each `SKILL.md` right after the front matter. Summaries are acceptable; keep detailed nuance in the reference files.

### üî¥ Priority 3: Orchestrator Auto-Activation (0.5 day)

**Action:** Add explicit triggers and default behaviors so `bmad-orchestrator` starts every BMAD conversation automatically and routes users to the next phase.

### üî¥ Priority 4: Activation Regression Tests (0.5 day)

**Action:** Create `tests/test_skill_activation.md` with scripted dialogues that verify automatic invocation across phases.

## 5. EVIDENCE LOG

| Evidence | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Manifest review | `meta/MANIFEST.json` |
| Skill contracts | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Activation rules | `.claude/skills/*/REFERENCE.md` |
| Test coverage | `tests/` |
| Documentation set | `doc/` |

## 6. NEXT STEPS

1. Apply the conversational description updates.  
2. Move activation guidance into `SKILL.md`.  
3. Update orchestrator behaviors and add regression tests.  
4. Re-run the audit to confirm the new 95/100 score.
