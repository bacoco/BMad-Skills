## UX Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First:** Interface should be clean and uncluttered. Advanced features accessible but not intrusive.

2. **Speed of Input:** Creating a task should take seconds. Reduce clicks and friction.

3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between active/complete, urgent/normal, important/routine.

4. **Contextual Actions:** Actions appear when needed (hover, selection) to keep interface clean.

5. **Forgiving Experience:** Easy undo, confirmation for destructive actions, recoverable mistakes.

6. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show basic features immediately, reveal advanced features as users need them.

7. **Consistency:** Predictable patterns for similar actions throughout the app.

8. **Feedback & Delight:** Satisfying animations when completing tasks, clear feedback for all actions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Layout
- **Clean Dashboard:** Primary view shows task input at top, task list below
- **Sidebar:** Lists and filters in collapsible left sidebar
- **No Clutter:** Hide optional fields until user needs them
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first design that scales to desktop

### Visual Design
- **Modern Aesthetic:** Clean, contemporary design with subtle shadows and borders
- **Color Psychology:**
  - Green for completed tasks (success)
  - Red for overdue (urgency)
  - Orange for high priority (attention)
  - Blue for accent/interactive elements
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts (minimum 16px body text)
- **White Space:** Generous spacing for visual breathing room

### Interactions
- **Quick Add:** Prominent input field always visible
- **Inline Editing:** Click any task to edit directly
- **Drag & Drop:** Reorder tasks and move between lists
- **Swipe Actions:** Mobile swipe for complete/delete
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - `N` - New task
  - `Enter` - Save task
  - `Esc` - Cancel
  - `/` - Focus search
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Command palette

### States
- **Empty State:** Friendly illustration and call-to-action for first-time users
