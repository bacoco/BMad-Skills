# FULL AUDIT REPORT ‚Äì BMAD Skills Repository
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Auditor:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Overall Score:** 96/100

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The BMAD Skills repository has completed the conversational activation remediation identified in the previous review. Conversational descriptions now live directly in `meta/MANIFEST.json`, every skill exposes a "When to Invoke" section in `SKILL.md`, and scripted activation scenarios are documented for regression coverage. Technical architecture, governance, and modularity remain exemplary.

### Verdict

**READY FOR PRODUCTION WITH LIGHTWEIGHT FOLLOW-THROUGH**

Current focus shifts from structural fixes to operational rigor: automating the conversational regression scripts and wiring activation telemetry into the included metrics tooling will close the final assurance gap.

## 1. ALIGNMENT WITH CLAUDE AI BEST PRACTICES

### ‚úÖ Areas of Excellence (95‚Äì100%)

#### Conversational Activation Layer ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Manifest descriptions use trigger-oriented phrasing for every skill, enabling Claude to auto-detect intent without manual commands (`meta/MANIFEST.json`).
- Each `SKILL.md` now front-loads auto-invocation guidance, including prerequisites and guardrails (e.g., `.claude/skills/main-workflow-router/SKILL.md`).
- Conversational flow documentation and troubleshooting guidance reinforce natural handoffs across phases (`doc/conversational-flow.md`, `doc/troubleshooting.md`).

#### Progressive Disclosure & Modularity ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Twelve independently loadable skills preserve the original layered architecture.
- Skill contracts continue to stay under 500 lines with reference material split into `REFERENCE.md`.
- Shared tooling and templates remain centralized under `shared/`.

#### Governance & Quality Gates ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Style, glossary, and workflow scripts are unchanged and still govern deliverables.
- `CHECKLIST.md` enforcement is reiterated inside downstream skills (e.g., `bmad-development-execution`).

## 2. REMAINING GAPS (Moderate Severity)

### üü† Gap #1: Conversational Tests Are Manual (Score: 80%)
**Symptom:** `tests/test_skill_activation.md` outlines eight scenarios but requires a human to execute them.

**Impact:** Regression coverage depends on manual reenactment, leaving room for drift between manifest descriptions and observed activations.

**Recommendation:** Convert the scripted scenarios into an automated harness (e.g., lightweight pytest or prompt playback script) that can be run pre-release.

---

### üü† Gap #2: Activation Metrics Not Yet Fed (Score: 80%)
**Symptom:** `shared/tooling/activation_metrics.py` can log and analyze activation data, yet no baseline dataset ships in `docs/`.

**Impact:** Teams lack visibility into real-world trigger success rates and cannot trend activation quality over time.

**Recommendation:** Capture sample conversations after each release, commit anonymized activation logs to `docs/activation-metrics.yaml`, and integrate the metrics script into the release checklist.

---

### üü¢ Observation: Workflow Status Bootstrap (Score: 90%)
`main-workflow-router` documents auto-start behaviors and state management expectations, but the repository still ships without a seed `docs/bmad-workflow-status.md`. Providing a template would help first-time adopters confirm the orchestration loop end-to-end.

## 4. COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS SINCE PRIOR AUDIT

1. **Manifest overhaul:** All twelve skills now provide conversational descriptions tuned for automatic activation (`meta/MANIFEST.json`).
2. **Skill contracts updated:** ‚ÄúWhen to Invoke‚Äù sections surfaced in each `SKILL.md`, clarifying triggers, prerequisites, and guardrails (e.g., `.claude/skills/main-workflow-router/SKILL.md`).
3. **Documentation refresh:** Conversational flow, troubleshooting, and activation regression scripts were added or expanded (`doc/conversational-flow.md`, `doc/troubleshooting.md`, `tests/test_skill_activation.md`).

---

## 5. PRIORITY ACTION PLAN

1. **Automate conversational regression tests (0.5‚Äì1 day)**
   - Convert `tests/test_skill_activation.md` into executable prompts.
   - Capture success/failure logs and integrate them into CI or release readiness checks.
2. **Instrument activation metrics (0.5 day)**
   - Run representative conversations, log data via `shared/tooling/activation_metrics.py`, and commit `docs/activation-metrics.yaml`.
   - Review low-confidence activations and expand trigger keywords accordingly.
3. **Ship workflow-status template (0.5 day)**
   - Provide a starter `docs/bmad-workflow-status.md` to demonstrate orchestrator state transitions.

2. Capture and analyze activation telemetry after the next dry run.
3. Publish a starter workflow-status artifact to demonstrate the orchestrator loop.
4. Re-run this audit to confirm the testing automation lifts the Test score to 95/100+.
