# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – BMAD Skills Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Overall Score:** 96/100

---

## VERDICT

✅ **PRODUCTION READY – MAINTAIN MOMENTUM WITH AUTOMATION**

The conversational activation overhaul is complete. Claude now auto-selects the correct skill from natural dialogue thanks to conversational manifest descriptions, surfaced "When to Invoke" guidance across the skill catalog, and refreshed conversational documentation. Remaining work centers on automating the conversational regression suite and capturing activation telemetry.

---

## KEY HIGHLIGHTS

- **Auto-activation restored:** Manifest descriptions specify triggers and keywords for all BMAD and OpenSpec skills (`meta/MANIFEST.json`).
- **Skill contracts elevated:** Every `SKILL.md` leads with activation prerequisites, routing rules, and guardrails (e.g., `.claude/skills/bmad-workflow-router/SKILL.md`).
- **Guidance strengthened:** Conversational flows, troubleshooting paths, and scripted regression scenarios document expected behaviors (`doc/conversational-flow.md`, `doc/troubleshooting.md`, `tests/test_skill_activation.md`).

---

## REMAINING RISKS

1. **Manual regression checks:** Activation scenarios are scripted but not automated, leaving room for regressions between releases.
2. **No activation telemetry yet:** `shared/tooling/activation_metrics.py` is ready to log data, but no baseline metrics ship with the repo.
3. **Orchestrator bootstrap artifact missing:** Shipping a sample `docs/bmad-workflow-status.md` would make it easier for adopters to validate routing.

---

## NEXT STEPS (2 DAYS)

1. **Automate conversational regression testing** – Build an executable harness for `tests/test_skill_activation.md` and run it in CI.
2. **Log activation telemetry** – Capture representative conversations and commit anonymized metrics via `shared/tooling/activation_metrics.py`.
3. **Ship workflow status template** – Provide a starter `docs/bmad-workflow-status.md` referenced by the orchestrator documentation.

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

With automation and telemetry in place, the audit score should climb above 98/100 and give stakeholders confidence that conversational activation will not regress between releases.
