# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ‚Äì BMAD Skills Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Overall Score:** 85/100 ‚Üí **95/100 after corrective work**

---

## VERDICT

‚úÖ **READY FOR PRODUCTION AFTER TARGETED FIXES**

The technical architecture earns an **excellent 95/100**, but the automatic conversational activation currently scores **45/100** and must improve to meet the Bimath method expectations.

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### üî¥ Issue #1: Manual Skill Activation
**Impact:** Users need to invoke skills explicitly instead of enjoying a natural conversation flow.

**Root cause:** `meta/MANIFEST.json` still uses technical descriptions rather than conversational ones.

**Example:**
```yaml
# Current (technical)
"description": "Clarifies ambiguous opportunities through structured research..."

# Target (conversational)
"description": "Brainstorms ideas. Invoke when: 'I have an idea', 'What if', 'brainstorm'. Keywords: idea, explore, research."
```

### üî¥ Issue #2: Activation Guidance Hidden in References
**Impact:** ‚ÄúWhen to invoke‚Äù details live in `REFERENCE.md` instead of `SKILL.md`, so Claude does not load them during intent matching.

**Fix:** Move the activation contract to each `SKILL.md` immediately after the YAML front matter.

### üî¥ Issue #3: Manual Orchestration
**Impact:** `bmad-orchestrator` waits for a command rather than auto-starting at the beginning of BMAD conversations.

**Fix:** Add explicit conversational triggers and default auto-behavior.

---

## STRENGTHS (What Already Works Well)

‚úÖ **Progressive disclosure architecture:** 95/100  
‚úÖ **Modularity (12 skills):** 100/100  
‚úÖ **Governance & quality gates:** 95/100  
‚úÖ **Documentation depth:** 95/100  
‚úÖ **Scripts and templates:** 100/100

---

## ACTION PLAN

### Essential fixes (2‚Äì3 days of focused work)

1. **Rewrite twelve descriptions** in `meta/MANIFEST.json` with conversational triggers (1 day).
2. **Add ‚ÄúWhen to Invoke‚Äù sections** to every `SKILL.md` (1 day).
3. **Update `bmad-orchestrator`** to auto-activate at the start of any BMAD conversation (0.5 day).
4. **Author activation tests** with realistic dialogue scenarios (0.5 day).

### Files to update

**`meta/MANIFEST.json`:**
- Replace every description with the conversational versions.

**Eight `SKILL.md` files:**
- Insert a ‚ÄúWhen to Invoke‚Äù section after the YAML front matter.
- Document concrete trigger phrases, keywords, and guardrails.

**Tests:**
- Create `tests/test_skill_activation.md`.
- Validate the changes with real users or scripted prompts.

## EXPECTED RESULT

### Before fixes

```
User: "I have an idea for an app"
Claude: "Interesting, tell me more."
User: "Initialize BMAD workflow"
Claude: [bmad-orchestrator activates]
```

### After fixes

```
User: "I have an idea for an app"
Claude: [bmad-analyst auto-activates]
        "Great! Let me guide a brainstorming session‚Ä¶"
```

## BEST PRACTICE COMPLIANCE

| Anthropic Best Practice | Current | Target |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|
| Progressive disclosure  | 95%     | 95% ‚úÖ |
| Descriptions < 160 chars| 100%    | 100% ‚úÖ |
| SKILL.md < 500 lines    | 100%    | 100% ‚úÖ |
| Auto-selection keywords | 40%     | 95% üéØ |
| Conversational triggers | 45%     | 95% üéØ |

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Status: Production-ready after 2‚Äì3 days of activation-focused corrections.**

The BMAD Skills system is technically outstanding. Once the conversational activation improvements land, the score will climb to 95/100 and the suite will comply with the Bimath methodology: users speak naturally and Claude invokes the right skills without manual commands.
